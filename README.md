Wear Connect is a C2C (Customer-to-Customer) e-commerce website that allows users to act as both renters and rental providers.

Rental providers can upload images of their clothing items along with relevant information such as size and hourly rental price. Renters can search for clothing by category or style and then proceed to book the items for their desired rental period.

The system supports core rental-related functions, including rental order management, deposit handling, online payment processing, rental status tracking (ongoing, returned, completed), and refund processing when necessary. In addition, WearConnect provides a rating and review feature that allows users to evaluate each other after completing a transaction, thereby enhancing trust and transparency within the platform.

WearConnect aims to optimize clothing utilization, reduce unnecessary purchases, help users save costs, and promote sustainable consumption through a sharing economy model.
